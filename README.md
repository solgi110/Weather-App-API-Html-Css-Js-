# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with vanilla JavaScript.

The app uses the browser's Geolocation API to get the user's current location and fetches weather data based on latitude and longitude.

## Features
- Get current weather using device location
- Fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Simple UI with basic weather information

## How it works
When the user allows location access, the app retrieves latitude and longitude and sends them to the weather API. The response is then displayed on the page.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Geolocation API
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Usage
Just open the project in a browser (or via localhost), allow location access, and the weather information will be shown.
